Lovely, warm, and Theo right hostess also looked after our table and went out of her way to give detailed ingredients in every dish to avoid allergies for one of us. And the food was great! Guacamole made right at our table, everything prepared with our allergies in mind, and great dish recommendations. We'd been visiting Sydney for about a week from Melbourne, and this was by far our best dining experience. I'd definitely return here in the future.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf y-css-1wfz87z\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">The food was decent not great..  We had the guacamole which was bland and came with some type of plantain chips.. The chicken and steak tacos were good.. But the service was poor. We had a waitress with an attitude. She seemed upset whenever we asked for anything.  She would walk by and just stick up her hand and say \" just wait \".  She spilled the ingredients to make the guacamole all over the table but never apologized. The waitress didn't come by at all, not even once to check on us.. I will not go back. Suggest you find a Mexican restaurant that really wants your business..</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf y-css-1wfz87z\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Food was okay, guacamole was below average.

The menu is large so we went with the \\\"feed me\\\" selection. All you need to do is sit back and let the chef feed you.
